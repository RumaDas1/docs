# How To Withdraw From Tornado Cash
Users can withdraw their tokens from the Tornado cash platform at any time but to ensure high-level privacy it is recommended to wait until there are a few deposits after yours.
For Withdraw, users are required to provide two details:
- Note 
- Recipient Address

Fill in the mandatory details. You can get the Note details from the deposit transaction.
Once your fill in the note details, all details about your deposit get displayed.

From the Withdraw setting tab, you can choose two options for withdrawal:
- Via  Relayer 
- Web3 wallet

You can choose the withdrawal method as Wallet but for that, you need to have a completely new Ethereum address with some ETH on it. But getting some ETH will eventually lead to the loss of anonymity.

Thus, it is recommended to choose the withdrawal method as Relayer. A relayer is used to preserve privacy. With Relayer, there is no way to link a connection between the withdrawal and the deposit addresses.

Once you select this method to withdraw, your zk-Snark proof gets generated. 
The zkSnark technology is a method that helps the users to verify that they possess a secret to an unspent commitment from the list of deposit smart contracts without actually revealing the exact deposit corresponds to a secret.

Confirm the process.
You can now see the withdrawal transaction details at the bottom. 
One interesting thing you can note here is that the userâ€™s reward is continuously increasing.

To cross- verify the anonymity, click on the transaction hash and check the ethereum addresses mentioned on the log.

You can easily check that the source address is something different from your wallet address. 
Also, no transaction details will appear in the destination wallet address.

As a good practice, it is recommended to save the note data for future use, once you have successfully withdrawn your funds. In our next article, we will explain how you can use this note data to verify the transaction compliance record.
